I want to make dummy data that is mostly matched with the real data from back-end.
Here is the description. You can randomize to create data.
The data flow is by searching measurement history from search bar, and 
when a user click the result, profile and summary data need to be called.

[Measuremet history]
This data shows what have been measured from the AFM tools

The data goes, 

fab: Fab identifier (R3, M14, M16), tend to be short with first alphabet letter and one or two digit number.
lot_id: Starts with alphabets and mix of numbers. example -> T7HQK84T1, COM62353
wf_id: numbers from 1 to 25
lot_wf: combination of lot and workflow = T7HQK84T1_14
group_key: Grouping_key combining fab_lot_id_wf_id. example -> R3_T7HQK84T1_14

point: Measurement point number (1, 2, 3, 4..)
x_axis: coordinates of the measurement point for x
y_axis: coordinates of the measurement point for y
parameter: one of these (RQ_value, RA_value, RMAX_value)
value: measured_value
event_time: timestamp of the event 
rcp_id: Recipe identifier (example: BSOXCMP_DISHING_9PT, normally comes with two underbars)


[profile data]
The profile is related to the each measurement point from the recipe.
From the measurement history, when a user want to see the detail from a specific point, 
this data needs to be called. 

data size is around 20,000
surface size can be variable like (X, Y)
It is the form of surface data (like heat map)

data format is in X, Y, Z
X	Y	Z
0.0000	0.0000	0.063871275
0.1074	0.0000	0.094706873
0.2148	0.0000	0.248826780
0.5371	0.0000	-0.095052670
...
0.0000	0.1245	0.032523583
...
55.0000 25.0000 0.23513532

The data range is determined by X, Y from the surface size. 
if X, Y is 55, 25 then 20,000 exists between X = 0~55 and Y = 0~25
You can decide the range of X and Y and the data points between them. 
Z is the data for surface height such that it should be somehow continuous to describe the surface fluctuations.


[Summary Data]
This data contains statistical information for each point
For example, the data goes like,

Point, No X, No Y, ID, State, Left_H, Right_H
1, 5386.64, -586.31, 1, TRUE, 8.255, 8.785
...
5, 5389.72, 73428.53, 5, TRUE, 4.973, 4.512
and so on.
