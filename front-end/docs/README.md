- Anyone wanting to understand modern web application architecture

## Learning Approach

This documentation uses the AFM data platform as a **practical learning vehicle**, combining:
- Real-world semiconductor engineering context
- Progressive skill building from basics to advanced concepts
- Hands-on examples with AFM measurement data
- Professional development practices

## Current Project Features

The AFM data platform currently includes:

### Implemented Features
- **Main Search Interface**: Search and filter AFM measurement data
- **Results Display**: View measurement data in organized lists and cards
- **Search History**: Track previously viewed measurements
- **Data Grouping**: Compare multiple measurements side by side
- **Detailed Views**: Examine individual measurement properties
- **Trend Analysis**: Multi-measurement comparison and analysis pages

### In Development
- Enhanced data visualization (interactive charts and graphs)
- Real-time measurement monitoring
- Advanced filtering and sorting capabilities

## Getting Started

### For Comprehensive Learning (Recommended)
1. **Start with [Chapter 1: 시작하기 전에](./tutorials/Chapter%201_시작하기%20전에.md)** - Introduction and foundations
2. **Progress through individual chapters** - Each builds on the previous
3. **Reference the [Glossary](./glossary.md)** - When encountering new terms
4. **Practice hands-on examples** - Modify code as you learn

### For Quick Reference
1. **Use the [Consolidated Guide](./claude.md)** - Overview of all concepts
2. **Jump to specific sections** - When you need quick answers

## Learning Tips

- **Don't fear the code**: Start simple and build understanding gradually
- **Practice is essential**: Read explanations, then try modifying examples
- **Errors are learning opportunities**: Debug messages teach valuable lessons
- **Learn incrementally**: Master one concept before moving to the next
